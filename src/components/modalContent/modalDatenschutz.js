                remain with us until the purpose for which it was collected no longer applies. If you assert a justified
                request for deletion or revoke your consent to data processing, your data will be deleted, unless we
                have other legally permissible reasons for storing your personal data (e.g., tax or commercial law
                retention periods); in the latter case, the deletion will take place after these reasons cease to apply.
            </p>
            <h3>General information on the legal basis for the data processing on this website</h3>{" "}
            <p>
                If you have consented to data processing, we process your personal data on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a)
                GDPR or Art. 9 (2)(a) GDPR, if special categories of data are processed according to Art. 9 (1) DSGVO.
                In the case of explicit consent to the transfer of personal data to third countries, the data processing
                is also based on Art. 49 (1)(a) GDPR. If you have consented to the storage of cookies or to the access
                to information in your end device (e.g., via device fingerprinting), the data processing is additionally
                based on § 25 (1) TTDSG. The consent can be revoked at any time. If your data is required for the
                fulfillment of a contract or for the implementation of pre-contractual measures, we process your data on
                the basis of Art. 6(1)(b) GDPR. Furthermore, if your data is required for the fulfillment of a legal
                obligation, we process it on the basis of Art. 6(1)(c) GDPR. Furthermore, the data processing may be
                carried out on the basis of our legitimate interest according to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR. Information on the
                relevant legal basis in each individual case is provided in the following paragraphs of this privacy
                policy.

                Among other things, we use tools of companies domiciled in the United States or other from a data

                potentially be transferred to these non-EU countries and may be processed there. We must point out that
                in these countries, a data protection level that is comparable to that in the EU cannot be guaranteed.
                For instance, U.S. enterprises are under a mandate to release personal data to the security agencies and
                you as the data subject do not have any litigation options to defend yourself in court. Hence, it cannot
                be ruled out that U.S. agencies (e.g., the Secret Service) may process, analyze, and permanently archive
                your personal data for surveillance purposes. We have no control over these processing activities.

                from gaining access to the communication content. However, WhatsApp does gain access to metadata created
                during the communication process (for example, sender, recipient, and time). We would also like to point
                out that WhatsApp has stated that it shares personal data of its users with its U.S.-based parent
                company Facebook. Further details on data processing can be found in the WhatsApp privacy policy at:{" "}

                The use of WhatsApp is based on our legitimate interest in communicating as quickly and effectively as
                possible with customers, interested parties and other business and contractual partners (Art. 6(1)(f)
                GDPR). If a corresponding consent has been requested, data processing is carried out exclusively on the
                basis of the consent; this consent may be revoked at any time with effect for the future.
            </p>{" "}
            <p>
                The communication content exchanged between and on WhatsApp remains with us until you request us to
                delete it, revoke your consent to storage or the purpose for which the data is stored ceases to apply
                (e.g. after your request has been processed). Mandatory legal provisions, in particular retention
                periods, remain unaffected.

                storage of cookies or the access to information in the user’s end device (e.g., device fingerprinting)

            <p>
                Our website embeds videos of the website YouTube. The website operator is Google Ireland Limited
                (“Google”), Gordon House, Barrow Street, Dublin 4, Ireland.
            </p>{" "}
            <p>
                We use YouTube in the expanded data protection mode. According to YouTube, this mode ensures that
                YouTube does not store any information about visitors to this website before they watch the video.
                Nevertheless, this does not necessarily mean that the sharing of data with YouTube partners can be ruled
                out as a result of the expanded data protection mode. For instance, regardless of whether you are
                watching a video, YouTube will always establish a connection with the Google DoubleClick network.
            </p>{" "}
            <p>
                As soon as you start to play a YouTube video on this website, a connection to YouTube’s servers will be
                established. As a result, the YouTube server will be notified, which of our pages you have visited. If
                you are logged into your YouTube account while you visit our site, you enable YouTube to directly
                allocate your browsing patterns to your personal profile. You have the option to prevent this by logging
                out of your YouTube account.
            </p>{" "}
            <p>
                Furthermore, after you have started to play a video, YouTube will be able to place various cookies on
                your device or comparable technologies for recognition (e.g. device fingerprinting). In this way YouTube
                will be able to obtain information about this website’s visitors. Among other things, this information
                will be used to generate video statistics with the aim of improving the user friendliness of the site
                and to prevent attempts to commit fraud.
            </p>{" "}
            <p>
                Under certain circumstances, additional data processing transactions may be triggered after you have
                started to play a YouTube video, which are beyond our control.

                The use of YouTube is based on our interest in presenting our online content in an appealing manner.
                Pursuant to Art. 6(1)(f) GDPR, this is a legitimate interest. If appropriate consent has been obtained,
                the processing is carried out exclusively on the basis of Art. 6(1)(a) GDPR and § 25 (1) TTDSG, insofar
